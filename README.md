# 4th Year Applied Project
## *An Analysis of the Viability and Volatility of Cryptocurrency* with Currency Analyser Webapp

> Module: Applied Project and Minor Dissertation / 4th Year Software Development   
> Team: Rebecca Kane, Tara O'Kelly (Group 3.2)  
> Supervisor: Dr Ian McLoughlin  

## General Plan
We aim to create a currency analyser, including both traditional currencies and some of the major digital currencies, like [Bitcoin](https://www.bitcoin.com/) and [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/). We aim to incorporate machine learning to analyse past fluctuations in various currency prices, and *attempt* to decipher a trend in prices - obviously we can't predict the future.   

## Team Partition
Original Team: John Glynn, Rebecca Kane, Tara O'Kelly  

The team made the collective decision to separate at the beginning of April. While this did come at a crucial stage of the project, all members agreed it was the best option. There were a variety of reasons behind this decision, to be discussed in Chapter 4 of the dissertation, and fortunately all team members are still on amicable terms.  

All work prior to 9 April 2018 is considered a collaborative effort and is authorised to be used by either new team. The work of this repository is related to Team 3.2 - Rebecca Kane and Tara O'Kelly.  

## Outline of Project  
Our project consists of two major components; a theoretical analysis of cryptocurrency, and an applied aspect in the form of a web application.

### Theoretical Aspect  
The theoretical component of our project is discussed in detail in our dissertation, and focuses on two subjects; understanding cryptocurrency and why it should be considered a viable method of trading, and predicting the prices of cryptocurrency and their associated volatility. We used this format as we believe there still exists a great deal of mystery surrounding cryptocurrency to the average person, and wanted to provide a resource suitable for even the most inexperienced of users.  

**Understanding Cryptocurrency**  
In this chapter, we start from the basics of what exactly cryptocurrency is and its underlying technologies. We explain the very beginnings of cryptocurrency back in the 1990s, followed by an introduction to cryptocurrency today. We explain the characteristics of most cryptocurrencies, such as decentralised systems, anonymity, mining and trading cryptocurrency, and how all of this makes cryptocurrency different from traditional currency. We discuss Bitcoin, the most famous (and expensive) of cryptocurrencies and its origins, as well as the innovative technology known as Blockchain that it brought to the world. We then conclude the chapter by summarising the various aspects which make cryptocurrency a viable asset to be traded.

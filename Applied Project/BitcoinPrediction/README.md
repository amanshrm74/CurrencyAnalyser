## Branch: Prediction
This branch holds all content related to prediction of prices/trends, including tensorflow/machine learning work and any computation/theories.  

Currently working on a basic prototype to predict based off 31 days of Bitcoin prices (12 Jan - 11 Feb).

Briefly looking through stuff, will update with more info if used in project.  
  
http://mourafiq.com/2016/05/15/predicting-sequences-using-rnn-in-tensorflow.html - not exactly what we're looking for but could be good to look at.  
  
https://medium.com/mlreview/a-simple-deep-learning-model-for-stock-price-prediction-using-tensorflow-30505541d877 - interesting read, repeats much of what we learned in Emerging Technologies in first semester of 4th year but will test out code etc.  
  
https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2017/07/08/predict-stock-prices-using-RNN-part-1.html - similar to above but seems to have more detail/technical info.

https://medium.com/@huangkh19951228/predicting-cryptocurrency-price-with-tensorflow-and-keras-e1674b0dc58a - tensorflow/keras with Python 2.7  
  
https://dashee87.github.io/deep%20learning/python/predicting-cryptocurrency-prices-with-deep-learning/ - lot of detail, uses LSTM model, predicts BTC & ETH.

\centerline{\textbf{Abstract}}

The field of cryptocurrency has enjoyed exponential growth in popularity in recent years. Almost ten years ago, the release of Bitcoin marked the beginning of a new era of innovation in the financial sector. In this dissertation we outline what exactly defines a cryptocurrency, describing fundamental concepts, underlying technologies such as the blockchain, and subsequently the viability of this new digital financial asset. Building on this knowledge, we examine the infamous volatility of cryptocurrency prices, analysing pricing data and the likelihood of these currencies, specifically Bitcoin, being in the midst a financial bubble. We examine the prediction of prices, or rather inability to do so, before introducing the Currency Analyser web application developed as part of this project. Containing up to date prices, this web application is hosted on Heroku for public access and predicts prices of Bitcoin using machine learning. The research, planning methodologies, technologies, and design and evaluation of this application are described in detail in the penultimate chapter of this dissertation, followed by a concluding word on the process as a whole.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
The authors wish to thank their fellow students, who offered advice on many aspects of this project on many occasions. 

We would also like to acknowledge the many lecturers we have had the pleasure of knowing throughout our time at Galway Mayo Institute of Technology, many of whom have left a lasting impression on us and will continue to inspire our work long after our time at GMIT has come to an end. 

We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude towards our families and friends for bearing with us in our stressed and worried states, always willing to offer listening ears and emotional support.

Last but certainly not least, we wish to sincerely thank our project supervisor, Dr. Ian McLoughlin, for offering endless advice on every aspect of this project. His always calm and collected nature never failed to reassure us, even when we were at our most stressed. The advice of "get some cake, take a break" will forever encourage us in times of frustration.

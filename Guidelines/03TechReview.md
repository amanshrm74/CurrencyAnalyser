# "Technology Review"  

__*10+ pages (8-10k words)*__  
*The “literature review” part of the dissertation. Should be tightly coupled to the context and objective from the introduction. Proves that you researched what you were doing.*  

Describe each of the technologies you used at a conceptual level.  
Standards, Database Model (e.g. MongoDB, CouchDB), XMl, WSDL, JSON, JAXP.  
Use references (IEEE format, e.g. [1]), Books, Papers, URLs (timestamp). Sources should be authoritative! A technology review that includes a lot of de facto or de jure standards supports the methodology!  
Each chapter buttresses some other aspect of the dissertation.  

### Supervisor Advice
Don't approach as a literature review, focus on making sure it ties in well with project and rest of dissertation. Research the idea and write about technologies used to achieve goals, theory behind it etc. Should be the "body/middle" of the dissertation.  

### Main Technologies  
Python, Vuejs, Chartjs, TensorFlow, Redis, Mongo, D3js, Flask, Heroku, AWS/Azure. Some since scrapped but will need to discuss all anyway.

### Notes  
Section may be broken up into different sections and added to dissertation separately rather than one whole review - won't need introduction to this if main intro is done right, same goes for conclusion. Maybe conclude on each technology?   

Is bitcoin a bubble? On a theoretical level - recent crashes, volatility of coin, inflation since it began etc. Basic-ish explanation of how traditional stocks/currencies are affected by events (project focuses on crypto, should be more detail for that).

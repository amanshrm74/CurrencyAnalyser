# Introduction

__*5 pages / 3-4000 words*__  
*What is it about? Is it at the right level (8)? Is the scope correct? Do not assume that the reader knows anything about the domain.*  
  
Why should a reader care or be interested?  
Set out the objectives of the project clearly  
You will have to address each of these in the evaluation / conclusion.  
The metrics by which success or failure is measured.  
Briefly list each chapter / section and provide a brief description of what each section contains.  
List the resource URL (GitHub address) for the project and provide a brief list and description of the main elements at the URL.  

After reading the introduction, a reader should be 100% certain of what the project is all about and why it is relevant.

**Notes**  
Referring to cryptocurrency as CC from here, will correct for submission. Traditional currency = TC.  

In recent years CC has grown from an unheard of concept into something everyone has heard of, more and more people buying/at least talking about it, features heavily in online news outlets, blog sites, reddit/hackernews/twitter etc. 

Unlike TC, based on world events/country status/economy/disasters/war etc, CC based solely on hype (? will look into it more later on). Functions more like a stock than actual currency. All digital, no physical currency. Decentralised (not in one place) unlike TC, centralised in banks etc. Security (ECC), blockchain.

# Methodology  

__*3-5 pages (2-3000 words)*__  
*Describe the way you went about your project. Was your approach to the problem valid?*  
  
Software development v/s Research methodology. Agile / incremental and iterative approach to development.  
Planning. Did you storyboard? How did you determine the requirements for the project?  
Meetings. Frequency, structure, checks & balances, feedback. What about validation and testing?  
Junit or some other framework. If team based, did you use GitHub during the development process? What about other development tools?  
Selection criteria for algorithms, languages, platforms and technologies. Was an empirical approach used? How were problems solved?  
Was any research undertaken first?  

**Notes**  
Agile development. Standup meetings, regular phone conversations, google docs January onwards.  
Meet every weekday in college, at least to discuss issues/ideas. Work done on a weekly basis (i.e. not everyday), daily discussions regarding current status/work done.  

Might not be appropriate for thesis but hard to plan formally when we see and chat to each other every day, work just naturally gets done informally? Knew each other before project, get on very well, haven't really had any need to set very defined plans? Ask supervisor.  

Github used for dev process, master branch only used for major / critical stages in project.  
- **CA-Vue.js**  - mainly used by Tara, frontend. Handles Vue and Chartjs.  
- **CA-flask**  - used by Rebecca, has since been scrapped, technology will be integrated into Vue branch. No need to be separate as they both work very closely / Vue app dependent on flask server / tied together.  
- **Scripts**  - used by Johnny for the python scripts to pull data/handle db stuff.  

`develop` will combine above (working project in this branch), might be scrapped and just push above to master.  
`test` will handle testing, yet to be integrated. Testing currently done ad-hoc.  
`dissertation` concerns all thesis related stuff, anything from notes to outlining sections.


Supervisor meetings very rare, set out in first meeting that should be hands off approach. Weekly meetings unnecessary. only meet when we have questions.  
Met in Sept/Oct once, to propose idea and set out basic objectives.  
Met mid November to see where to go from there, had basic project (scripts pulling prices, chart done, had to tie them together) thrown together (throwaway prototyping), started talking about thesis.  
Met just before the Christmas break to discuss thesis & how to structure it in more detail, meeting focused on theory side of things.  
Meeting Monday 12th Feb to discuss some issues/concerns with how to proceed regarding front end (sockets/DB etc).  

**Project Timeline**  
Actual timeline graph available from presentation, will include that in this section.  
Began in late Sept, basic work done throughout Oct. Project took a back seat in November / December due to other more imminent deadlines.  
Started again in January, ran into issues (to be discussed) but communication with each other still constant.

# System Evaluation

__*x pages*__  
*Evaluate your project against the objective set out in the introduction.*  


Prove that your software is robust.  
Unit / acceptance testing for robustness / behaviour. Stability metrics for structure.  
Any tables / graphs of results belong here. Provide an accompanying discussion. Use performance benchmarks (space and time) if algorithmic. Measure the outcomes / outputs of your system / software against the objectives from the Introduction.  

Highlight any limitations or opportunities in your approach or technologies used. Identifying limitations is not a sign of weakness. It is proof of insight.  

**Notes**  
"Can't predict stock/prices etc" will be highlighted again here. Will also talk about accuracy of the machine learning aspect, will take predicted vs actual prices for a given week/longer and compare them. Not likely to be similar (unless markets stable, which they haven't been recently). *Further proof that you can't predict?*  

Is bitcoin etc a bubble? Based on results etc - crash in late Jan implies yes. *(Good for us/this project..?)*  

How well does webapp work - something people would use/be interested in, maybe carry out survey/ask for feedback from peers.
